            With our Core DB service, you can have a well-sorted and fully standardized core database that provides
            users
            with multiple functionalities, including but not limited to smart search, multi-filtering, visualization,
            and access through commonly used industry software.
            <br><br>
            We offer a fully automated web-based application with a user-friendly interface, comprising several pages
            dedicated to each data type as well as a separate admin functionality that will enable subject matter data
            managers to maintain the database. Alongside the with the platform, we offer processed and QC-ed all reports
            and partially QC source lab measurements, digitized pdf files where needed, combined and cleaned excel
            sheets, extracted necessary images from lab reports, and organized the database structure through close
            collaboration with the customer's core experts.

            Core data plays an essential role in the decision-making process at different stages of the field
            development, starting from the early exploration and appraisal phase through the entire extent of the
            development. The presence of readily available, sorted, QC-ed, and unified core measurements can boost
            efficiency during key decision-making points such as reserve re-evaluation, new well delivery, and lower
            completion selection as well as aid subject matter experts during reservoir related studies and research.
            <br><br>
            The customer's problem was that the available core data was stored in an unstructured manner with no
            conventional naming practices scattered across the numerous folders of different technical personnel. Hence,
            the unavailability of an integrated database created additional effort and inefficiency of pre-conditioning,
            sorting, and manual transfer of required data between different disciplines, which was diminishing the
            potential value that core data could bring in.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of the project was to come up with a well-sorted and fully standardized core database that
            provides users with multiple functionalities, including but not limited to smart search, multi-filtering,
            visualization, and access through commonly used industry software. A fully automated web-based application
            with a user-friendly user interface was developed and deployed on the customer's servers. The application
            comprises several pages dedicated to each data type as well as a separate admin functionality that will
            enable subject matter data managers to maintain the database. Alongside the development of the web
            application, our team processed and QC-ed all reports and partially QC-ed source lab measurements, digitized
            pdf files where needed, combined and cleaned excel sheets, extracted necessary images from lab reports, and
            organized the database structure through close collaboration with the customer's core experts.
