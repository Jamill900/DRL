            <p>
                Sand Production affects 50 % of global wells production leading to negative impact on the field
                development economics a result of production losses followed by well remediation costs as well as
                re-drilling a new well in during severe sanding events.
                <br><br>
                AIQUM (standing for AI as artificial intelligence and QUM as Sand in Azerbaijani language) is about
                development of the cutting-edge technology aiming to change the energy industry. The key concept is
                based on application of AI technologies on Big Data for detection and quantification of sand production
                in wells. Novelty of the approach is about integration of Fiber Technology (i.e., Distributed Acoustic
                Sensing - DAS) with nonintrusive Active Sensors (aka Ultrasonic), which simultaneously allows to
                “listen” and send acoustic waves through the flowline for better representation of multiphase flow with
                solid particles. By this, we also aim to mitigate the challenges of existing sand detection solutions in
                low rate production wells.

                This technology has been developing on flow loop facility manufactured since beginning of the project.
                The real-time outcome of this product installed on BP AGT's assets will step up safe operations and
                boost wells production expectancy. Technology is scalable to any asset where solids production becomes a
                bottleneck for efficient operations.
